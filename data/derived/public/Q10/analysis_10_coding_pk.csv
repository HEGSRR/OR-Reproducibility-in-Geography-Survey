19,R_3lXqZe3fUBXVpP8,Human,Qualitative,I have gone from  a one city based study to reproducing the research design over 6 cities in the global south in order to explore comparative urban research,3,
30,R_3JqhzhJtJOepNLz,Methods,Quantitative,"1. I had to apply an old method to a new study area. To ensure that all the steps and parameters are the same, I reproduced the results for the known study area before trying it on a new area.

2. We had developed a novel data on land cover, which appeared better than the ones already present in the literature. We had reservations about the quality of one of the existing datasets. To rigorously evaluate it under different settings, we reproduced the results using the pre-trained models published by the previous paper.",3,self-check also
43,R_3GiCVlcNYiS7jK0,Physical,Mixed Methods,"This may not fall into the pure idea of reproducibility, but when I find something in the field, I generally wonder if that is a local effect or if it can be spread more broadly. So I will sometimes rerun the experiment in an adjacent area (even just a few km away) to see if the effect is reproducible. If it is, then perhaps the effect is important and/or broadly applicable. If not, then maybe it is just a local effect or even a statistical anomaly.",3,
56,R_3Ecz7SpdhM7C3Ub,Nature/society,Mixed Methods,"Reproduction in different conditions and contexts helps to contrast and compare what works most of the time, some of the time, never. When a program such as our gender-sensitive, arts-aware Kool Routes to Schools works in very different schools, in different locations, during normal times, at home during the pandemic, and in public squares and quarantines eased, we could see what elements were important to reinforce. The Arts component became much more central to the program's resilience and to understanding and influencing participants' imaginaries regarding transportation and neighborhood life. In a sense we were ""reproducing"", with important adaptations, Safe Routes to School programs from the Global North (UK, US, Canada). We found very important modifications were central for them to work in the Global South (Chile).",3,

To avoid this issue in my own research, I've made effort to be more transparent about my own analytical assumptions.",2,
60,R_1mEtMwltGElYSPp,Physical,Quantitative,"This was largely in the context of ensuring quality within my own lab. I have students with less experience conducting different analyses. Reproducing the analysis myself or by someone else is a way to double-check the results.

It may be noteworthy that in these cases the source data is the same; only the analysis of the data is repeated. The re-collection of samples from the field would be too expensive. This context may be informative to my responses the question following this one.",2,
