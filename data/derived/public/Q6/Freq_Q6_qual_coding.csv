"Here is my personal definition of 'reproducibility': a method to evaluate study findings by repeating the experiment using the same parameters (potentially numerous times) and comparing the resulting data sets. Having dissimilar (nonreproduced) values may call the validity of the study’s methods into question, but it does not necessarily automatically invalidate the initial findings.
Reproducibility, in my opinion, seems to be a growing issue in certain quantitative studies, e.g. lab or survey work. 
My work is creating surficial geologic maps. In this context, the issue of reproducibility is unlikely to be realistically address due to some qualitative methods. The product is a representation of sedimentological and lithological interpretations which based on numerous observations which are combined with past knowledge to create interpretations. The scale, effort, and opportunistic nature (e.g. seeing a newly dug construction site) of data collection does not allow for the work to be easily reproduced. Areas are rarely re-mapped at the same scale. Some areas are not remapped in the same century. In other words, once created these maps are authoritative for generations. Which is not necessarily a good thing. 
",1,0.46728972,,1,1,1,1
"I am a paleoclimatologist working on sediment chronology and geochemistry. Thus, data reproducibility is the first priority in our research. Further, the paleoclimate reconstruction, we make as per the geochemical variability should corroborate and thus reproduced with the globally accepted understanding of the climatic episodes. ",1,0.46728972,,,,,1
I associate the term reproducibility mostly with quantitative methods and quantitative data. Although even in those contacts there can be quite a degree of variation in what is possible with respect to reproducibility. In my experience there is an increasing effort on the part of journals another publication venues to make the data underlying research reported and publications available with those publications. This is much easier to do with quantitative data (especially when it is anonymous). Essentially reproducibility boils down to the ability of researchers who may wish to check the results claim to buy other researchers.,1,0.46728972,,1,,1,
I don't use the term in my own research. To me it simply means that a certain result or set of results in a study can be reproduced in another study. ,1,0.46728972,,,,1,
"I have never heard it before in the context of my research. It was never mentioned in any of my PhD training programmes (UK). I assume it means: 'if someone else was to study this topic, would they come to the same conclusions'. In the social sciences, reproducibility is assumed to be difficult to achieve due to each researcher's positionality. Instead, we write our positionalities into our research and don't tend to strive for reproducibility per se, as life scientists would.",1,0.46728972,,,,1,1
I prefer using replicability. It means validate research results with a high degree of reliability if the analysis is replicated,1,0.46728972,1,,1,1,
"I study transportation infrastructure in cities (streets, sidewalks, bus stops, bike lanes, etc.). For any study I complete, I want the methods to be incredibly clear and datasets to be accessible, such that any interested researcher could re-do the entire study.

It strikes me as a term that makes more sense for researchers using quantitative methods, however.

",1,0.46728972,,,,,1
"In a broad sense, reproducibility in my research would mean that the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset always yield the same result. I distinguish it from research that is replicable, robust, or generalizable. Reproducibility requires a series of actions on the part of the researcher, such as when authors provide all the code and data necessary to recreate the analysis, as per Claerbout and Karrenback (1992), or when measurements can be independently obtained with stated precision levels by a different and independent research team, as per Ivie and Thain (2018) in ACM Comput Survey. Similar to Stodden's (2020) approach, I also consider computational reproducibility (code, hardware details, readme are made available), empirical reproducibility (open data, data access issues, appropriate interoperability, metadata, standards, ontological frameworks), and analytics reproducibility (details on model parameters, hyperparameters are made known). In my work, reproducibility crosses over into replicability - and it may be necessary to have replicability as the scientific threshold - where the same analytics performed on different datasets yields similar results. This is due to the fact that many of the datasets I work with are sensitive, containing potentially personally identifiable data, that requires special permission to use, or are not shareable because they are privately held, or are synthetically generated by private organizations. This is similar to code not being shareable if the provenance of legacy code is unavailable. Reproducible research is the gold standard and a desirable characteristic, but it may not always be possible, despite the researcher's desires and intentions.",1,0.46728972,,1,1,1,
"In short, I understand reproducibility to be the ability of other researchers to use the same methods on the same data to produce the same results.",1,0.46728972,,1,1,1,
"In short, the idea of reproducibility implies that, regardless of the researcher, when research is conducted using the same data, methods, and ideas/research questions, subsequent researchers will arrive at the same results.
As a geographer who largely employs qualitative methods, this notion reflects the grotesque extent to which qualitative researchers are expected to scientize (mimic the scientific vernacular, questions, and processes) in their work in order to acquire funding.
Working abroad with populations who do not share the same native language, where there are certainly different views and practices concerning gender, race/ethnicity, education, class, and varying stereotypes of who researchers are, what and why they're researching a particular topic, etc., this kind of notion of ""reproducibility"" is really a ridiculous idea that only the most quantitatively stuck (and socially stunted) human geographers would say is possible. It is not the same thing for physical geographers as it is for human geographers, in the same way that notions of what is generalizable do not align neatly and can even conflict.",1,0.46728972,,1,1,1,
"In the hard sciences it is ability to trace a research process in order to reconstruct how a specific outcome was achieved.

"There are two slightly different meanings for ""reproducibility"" for me. For all of my work, ""reproducibility"" requires adequate description of the methods involved in gathering and analyzing data. By ""adequate"" I mean a peer could duplicate the techniques in the same or similar contexts, but not necessarily with precisely the same data. This includes both quantitative (survey, census, etc.) data and qualitative information (interviews, documents, etc.) With the latter, for example, the identity of the interviewees is typically confidential, and non-anonymous survey data cannot be shared. 

For quantitative work, reproducibility means that peers would arrive at precisely the same conclusions using the (anonymous) data and analytic techniques. This is primarily a check on errors in the data and analyses, and a check on fraudulent practices. They may arrive at different conclusions using the same data but different techniques, or when combined with additional data. And of course, they may have different interpretations of the same results. ",1,0.46728972,,1,1,1,1
