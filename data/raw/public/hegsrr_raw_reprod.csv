Having dissimilar (nonreproduced) values may call the validity of the study’s methods into question, but it does not necessarily automatically invalidate the initial findings.
Reproducibility, in my opinion, seems to be a growing issue in certain quantitative studies, e.g. lab or survey work. 
My work is creating surficial geologic maps. In this context, the issue of reproducibility is unlikely to be realistically address due to some qualitative methods. The product is a representation of sedimentological and lithological interpretations which based on numerous observations which are combined with past knowledge to create interpretations. The scale, effort, and opportunistic nature (e.g. seeing a newly dug construction site) of data collection does not allow for the work to be easily reproduced. Areas are rarely re-mapped at the same scale. Some areas are not remapped in the same century. In other words, once created these maps are authoritative for generations. Which is not necessarily a good thing.

As a geographer who largely employs qualitative methods, this notion reflects the grotesque extent to which qualitative researchers are expected to scientize (mimic the scientific vernacular, questions, and processes) in their work in order to acquire funding.
Working abroad with populations who do not share the same native language, where there are certainly different views and practices concerning gender, race/ethnicity, education, class, and varying stereotypes of who researchers are, what and why they're researching a particular topic, etc., this kind of notion of ""reproducibility"" is really a ridiculous idea that only the most quantitatively stuck (and socially stunted) human geographers would say is possible.

This includes both quantitative (survey, census, etc.) data and qualitative information (interviews, documents, etc.) With the latter, for example, the identity of the interviewees is typically confidential, and non-anonymous survey data cannot be shared. 

For quantitative work, reproducibility means that peers would arrive at precisely the same conclusions using the (anonymous) data and analytic techniques. This is primarily a check on errors in the data and analyses, and a check on fraudulent practices. They may arrive at different conclusions using the same data but different techniques, or when combined with additional data.

I distinguish it from research that is replicable, robust, or generalizable. Reproducibility requires a series of actions on the part of the researcher, such as when authors provide all the code and data necessary to recreate the analysis, as per Claerbout and Karrenback (1992), or when measurements can be independently obtained with stated precision levels by a different and independent research team, as per Ivie and Thain (2018) in ACM Comput Survey. Similar to Stodden's (2020) approach, I also consider computational reproducibility (code, hardware details, readme are made available), empirical reproducibility (open data, data access issues, appropriate interoperability, metadata, standards, ontological frameworks), and analytics reproducibility (details on model parameters, hyperparameters are made known). In my work, reproducibility crosses over into replicability - and it may be necessary to have replicability as the scientific threshold - where the same analytics performed on different datasets yields similar results. This is due to the fact that many of the datasets I work with are sensitive, containing potentially personally identifiable data, that requires special permission to use, or are not shareable because they are privately held, or are synthetically generated by private organizations. This is similar to code not being shareable if the provenance of legacy code is unavailable.

It is not always possible to access that data to facilitate reproducibility by others. However, there are now a number of tools that can help move geographic analytics reproducibility to the next level.

As I discussed previously, reproducibility is a gold standard. When it is doable, it is great, and researchers should be supported with  reproducibility science, the tools and the know-how.

Most of the time many factors are overlooked, we would need an interdisciplinary framework and stabdarddisation of some key criteria to be described in all experimentation.
Fragmentation of research and lack of inter/transdisicplinary is the a big contributor to lack of reproducibility. Focusing on a specific effect with very little scope (E.G. one function in a geovisualization for instance) can lead to results with wery little to no significance. Many factors are just overlooked and would need to be observed by researchers from other disciplines.I worked with researchers in information and communication studies in experiments they made observations that no geographers could make. Segmenting and producing very specialized research is good for a career buit often useless : little significance, reproducibility if it exists, would not be very relevant anyway, situation are so far from real life that it is impossible to reuse. Specialization on very specific and technical topics sells good in sciences but failing to aim for a larger point of view and analysis often does not allow for the reuse of results.
So pressure to publish is also a huge factor in my opinion. if you want to be successful, you do not have the time to make transdicisplinary project, and you should not really take the time to discuss with other disciplines because others will publish more than you and get a job...","Principal investigator of the study,Peer-reviewer(s),Journal editor(s),Funding agency,Other (specify)","every researchers should have this goal in mind as an ethical requirement, and it should be a requirement  at least where there is public funding (which is the case in a lot of private corporations in many countrires)",Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,"Please not that my anwers above are my opinion. in practice, it is not a requirement and many have great careers and receive praise without allowing for reproducibility or pretending to.

In the end, it is really hard to aim for reproducibility when people know their job and career are linked to other factors and that aiming for it will delay them in their path.
