### Welcome
This is an interactive data visualization for
*Reproducible Research Practices and Barriers to Reproducible Research in Geography:Insights from a Survey*
by Peter Kedron, Joseph Holler, and Sarah Bardin.

The purpose of the survey was to systematically develop a baseline of information
about the state of reproducibility in geography
and to identify any important differences between subfields and methodological approaches.

This data was collected with an online Qualtrics survey from May 17 to June 10, 2022
from a random sample of researchers publishing in geographic academic journals as the corresponding author.

The survey inquires researchers about their:

1) understanding and **awareness** of reproducibility;
2) awareness and implementation of reproducible research **practices**;
3) **opinions** and perceptions about the role of reproducibility in geography and their subfield; and
4) **experience** attempting reproductions of prior studies.

Within each of these themes, responses can be viewed in aggregate (**Everyone**).

Alternatively, subsets of geographers can be selected
according to one of four *subfields* they are most closely associated with:

- **Human** geography;
- Spatial analysis and **methods**;
- **Nature/Society**; or
- **Physical** geography.

Or, one of three *methods* they most frequently use:
- **Quantitative**;
- **Qualitative**; or
- **Mixed Methods**.
