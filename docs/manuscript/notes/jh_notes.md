# Fields & Methods

Surprises:

- "Mixed methods" seems to mean different things to different subfields. E.g. I am surprised that half of the physical geographers used mixed methods, but they seem to include methods like qualitative interpretation of lithology types in mixed.
- 1/3 of spatial stats folks used mixed methods... I wonder what those methods may have been?
- Minority of human geographers and nature/society geographers report being primarily quantitative!

Conclusions:

- Geography is surprisingly diverse in both the thematic foci and methods applied
- This has difficult implications for R&R as we all approach the issue with different expectations for what R&R mean, whether and how R&R should be achieved, and how we may benefit from R&R at the levels of individual researchers, communities/subfields of interest, and the discipline as a whole.

# What is Reproducibility?

- Gradients of familiarity and interpretation of "reproducibility", with spatial stats, physical geog, and quantitative geog tend to be more "familiar" with the term than human geog & nature/society and qualitative researchers
- Lower familiarity respondents: tend to interpret reproducibility as *replicability*-- achieving similar results.
- Somewhat familiar respondents: gave a mix of reproducibility and replicability definitions, some emphasizing same site and some different sites
- great extent respondents: more sophisticated definitions more likely to emphasize reproducibility over replicability and more likely to denounce the notion (from qualitative research perspective); still a fair amount of emphasis on repeating procedures rather than results

Coding variables:
- Replication
- Same data
- Same procedure
- Same result
- *similar result*
- Same location
- Different location
- Same researcher
- Different researcher
