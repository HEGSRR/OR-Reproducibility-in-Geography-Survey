"53","Geographic methods, GIS, spatial statistics","Quantitative","To a great extent","Can others use methods we have used and replicate our results"
"54","Geographic methods, GIS, spatial statistics","Quantitative","To a great extent","In a broad sense, reproducibility in my research would mean that the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset always yield the same result. I distinguish it from research that is replicable, robust, or generalizable. Reproducibility requires a series of actions on the part of the researcher, such as when authors provide all the code and data necessary to recreate the analysis, as per Claerbout and Karrenback (1992), or when measurements can be independently obtained with stated precision levels by a different and independent research team, as per Ivie and Thain (2018) in ACM Comput Survey. Similar to Stodden's (2020) approach, I also consider computational reproducibility (code, hardware details, readme are made available), empirical reproducibility (open data, data access issues, appropriate interoperability, metadata, standards, ontological frameworks), and analytics reproducibility (details on model parameters, hyperparameters are made known). In my work, reproducibility crosses over into replicability - and it may be necessary to have replicability as the scientific threshold - where the same analytics performed on different datasets yields similar results. This is due to the fact that many of the datasets I work with are sensitive, containing potentially personally identifiable data, that requires special permission to use, or are not shareable because they are privately held, or are synthetically generated by private organizations. This is similar to code not being shareable if the provenance of legacy code is unavailable. Reproducible research is the gold standard and a desirable characteristic, but it may not always be possible, despite the researcher's desires and intentions."
"55","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Quantitative","To a great extent","For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study is replicated."

"58","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Quantitative","To a great extent","If another researcher (independent) performs the same experiments as I do, the outcomes should lie within a given uncertainty limit. The experiments should be repeatable and the results not a unique occurrence."
"59","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Quantitative","To a great extent","the description of the analysis should be given in a manner that an expert reader (as research is mostly communicated in written form) should be able to come to the same conclusions using sound scientific analyses and the same data. Access to data is critical as analysis tools generally accessible to anyone with sufficient expertise."
"60","Geographic methods, GIS, spatial statistics","Quantitative","To a great extent","Reproducible research usually publishes the data used to justify research claims. If the data cannot be published (as in my case), the description of the methods should allow researchers to replicate the results if they had the same data. These are the practical dimensions of reproducibility. Conceptually, reproducibility is about minimizing or eliminating the bias of subjective decisions, or contextualizing your findings with respect to the methodological choices you make as a researcher."
"61","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Quantitative","To a great extent","The methods should provide sufficient information to be able to reproduce the results. In quantitative science this should, at minimum, provide all the equations and algorithms used for any calculation.

"68","Human geography","Qualitative","To a great extent","In short, the idea of reproducibility implies that, regardless of the researcher, when research is conducted using the same data, methods, and ideas/research questions, subsequent researchers will arrive at the same results.
As a geographer who largely employs qualitative methods, this notion reflects the grotesque extent to which qualitative researchers are expected to scientize (mimic the scientific vernacular, questions, and processes) in their work in order to acquire funding.
Working abroad with populations who do not share the same native language, where there are certainly different views and practices concerning gender, race/ethnicity, education, class, and varying stereotypes of who researchers are, what and why they're researching a particular topic, etc., this kind of notion of ""reproducibility"" is really a ridiculous idea that only the most quantitatively stuck (and socially stunted) human geographers would say is possible. It is not the same thing for physical geographers as it is for human geographers, in the same way that notions of what is generalizable do not align neatly and can even conflict."

"72","Human geography","Qualitative","To a great extent","Working from a qualitative paradigm, research standards should be rigorous and transparent but qualitative research isn't necessarily reproducible - especially for ethnography, which is my preferred methodological approach. But outside of qualitative work I understand ""reproducibility"" to mean that statistical/data/empicial evidence should be able to be examined and analysis conducted by other researchers should be able to replicate the steps that the original researcher took to achieve their results."

"76","Geographic methods, GIS, spatial statistics","Mixed Methods","To a great extent","For my computational work, I provide the code and explanation of the methods and data such that others could conduct the same sorts of experiments and analysis that I have. In my more qualitative work, I make clear the methodological principles followed (semi-structured interview, coding, etc.) such that while the work may not be 'reproducible' in the same way, one could conduct a similar study.

Honestly, beyond testing my own results for rigor and ensuring that others can understand (and if they want adapt/revisit) my own analysis, I do not worry about this."

"80","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Mixed Methods","To a great extent","Here is my personal definition of 'reproducibility': a method to evaluate study findings by repeating the experiment using the same parameters (potentially numerous times) and comparing the resulting data sets. Having dissimilar (nonreproduced) values may call the validity of the study’s methods into question, but it does not necessarily automatically invalidate the initial findings.
Reproducibility, in my opinion, seems to be a growing issue in certain quantitative studies, e.g. lab or survey work. 
My work is creating surficial geologic maps. In this context, the issue of reproducibility is unlikely to be realistically address due to some qualitative methods. The product is a representation of sedimentological and lithological interpretations which based on numerous observations which are combined with past knowledge to create interpretations. The scale, effort, and opportunistic nature (e.g. seeing a newly dug construction site) of data collection does not allow for the work to be easily reproduced. Areas are rarely re-mapped at the same scale. Some areas are not remapped in the same century. In other words, once created these maps are authoritative for generations. Which is not necessarily a good thing.

In my experience there is an increasing effort on the part of journals another publication venues to make the data underlying research reported and publications available with those publications.

"151","Human geography","Qualitative","Somewhat","As a qualitative researcher doing in-depth case study research, my studies can not be perfectly reproduced. But reproducibility sits in the openness about methods and data collection practices, as well as critical reflection about strengths and weaknesses of my research. When we write about those things in the methods section in our papers and theses, their reproducibility is increased."
"152","Nature and society","Qualitative","Somewhat","The ability for results/observations to be replicated/ reproduced using/following the same methods and techniques. In the context of my field of research the concept is used to test the reliability of data obtained through experimental and observational research."

"154","Human geography","Qualitative","Somewhat","In the hard sciences it is ability to trace a research process in order to reconstruct how a specific outcome was achieved.
In the social sciences this does not make too much sense and I would interpret reproducibility as and ability to use an established research approach or methodology in order to achieve significant (not identical) results in a different research context"
"155","Nature and society","Qualitative","Somewhat","The objective of testing the results by using the same  methods"
"156","Human geography","Qualitative","Somewhat","to me this term would mean that the methods that have been used to conduct the research can be 'reproduced' by another researcher.  not quite the scientific hypothesis appraoch but not dissimilar"
"157","Human geography","Qualitative","Somewhat","As a historical geographer, working with qualitative research methods, I understand reproducibility more in terms of sources than of methods. I see reproducible research as being that which makes clear the origin and location of its data."

"177","Nature and society","Mixed Methods","Somewhat","That other researchers could use the same or similar methodology without great difficulty and, given similar data, arrive at comparable results"
"178","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Mixed Methods","Somewhat","My understanding is that the quantitative data my colleagues and I collect will be identical, or nearly so, to the data collected from the same site or similar sites by other researchers. Of course, the interpretation of those data will be subject to biases inherently present in each researcher."
"179","Human geography","Mixed Methods","Somewhat","To my understanding, reproducibility is a way in which a method, tool, and concept that one has originally produced in his/her research work can be reproduced in other research activities.  For example, OSMnx is a simple python code tool that has been developed by Prof. Geoff Boeing. The tool is used by other researchers to extract road networks from OSM. The road networks that are extracted using this tool can also be reproduced in many ways in ArcGIS."

"181","Physical geography, earth and environmental sciences","Mixed Methods","Somewhat","Repeatability of analyses and results"
"182","Human geography","Mixed Methods","Somewhat","There are two slightly different meanings for ""reproducibility"" for me. For all of my work, ""reproducibility"" requires adequate description of the methods involved in gathering and analyzing data. By ""adequate"" I mean a peer could duplicate the techniques in the same or similar contexts, but not necessarily with precisely the same data. This includes both quantitative (survey, census, etc.) data and qualitative information (interviews, documents, etc.) With the latter, for example, the identity of the interviewees is typically confidential, and non-anonymous survey data cannot be shared. 

For quantitative work, reproducibility means that peers would arrive at precisely the same conclusions using the (anonymous) data and analytic techniques. This is primarily a check on errors in the data and analyses, and a check on fraudulent practices. They may arrive at different conclusions using the same data but different techniques, or when combined with additional data. And of course, they may have different interpretations of the same results."

"201","Nature and society","Qualitative","Very little","I have never heard it before in the context of my research. It was never mentioned in any of my PhD training programmes (UK). I assume it means: 'if someone else was to study this topic, would they come to the same conclusions'. In the social sciences, reproducibility is assumed to be difficult to achieve due to each researcher's positionality. Instead, we write our positionalities into our research and don't tend to strive for reproducibility per se, as life scientists would."
