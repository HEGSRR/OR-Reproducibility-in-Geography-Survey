"","again, if the reproducibility is the research method, then this is important and valid, but if you are saying that the work could be reproduced with the same community group by another researcher to get the same results - it's just not appropriate.  As this doesn't take into account the personality of the researcher, how they may work, their positionalitiy (and the positionality of their research partners) and so on.","Again, not comments to make here","Archaeological survey is a field unfortunately cursed with diversity of practice. Adopting reproducible research practices will aid the spread of best practices globally, thereby improving the field altogether.","Countering the perverse incentives that currently exist to under-report methods and over-publish.","Defensibility of decisions based on this science","Do not think reproducibility is important.","Help to improve on what was done before","I do not have exact statistics/data about this, but I think reproducible research is more often cited? (this is basically a guess from my side)","If you get picky about ""same conditions"" then nothing in this observational, small- sample field is ever reproducible and reproducibility never and never will matter.","In my field validation and meta-analysis becomes critical when research results are applied in fore instance transport modelling. What is the right level for an elasticity? Its critical for the application and difficult to answer based on research results.","it's the underlying requirement of all science. No reproducibility, no science. The ones listed above are minor technical aspects.","Learning. Attempting a reproduction is an excellent way to learn about the field (techniques, methods, etc) and understand others' research in details.  I would say also a way to start collaborations with peers...","More open publishing","NA","none","Please not that my anwers above are my opinion. in practice, it is not a requirement and many have great careers and receive praise without allowing for reproducibility or pretending to. Others trying to allow it are not considered efficient enough (publications, etc.) and accordingly often do no get position in a university. In the end, it is really hard to aim for reproducibility when people know their job and career are linked to other factors and that aiming for it will delay them in their path. Most just do whath the systems take into account as successful research and they cannot be individually blame for it.","Possibility of examining long-term changes (if the test is repeated with the same method, it is possible to assess what long-term changes are taking place in the society). The previous researcher may be inactive or even dead.","Reliable and reproducible data will provide appropriate past climate reconstruction and even if their is some kind of minor climate perturbation not yet inferred, it can be confidently identified if the dataset is reliable and reproducible.","Reproducibility and open science/ open data is critically important for the innovation ecosystem, and for data-driven economic development. Having citable deposition of data and code are also important for interdisciplinary research because it is easier to ""get to the heart of the science"". It is important to get geographic research into repositories such as paperswithcode to expedite interdisciplinary connections.","research ethics","Results interpretation.  How a model is structured changes how results should be interpreted.  For example, even if dependent and independent variables are the same, interpretation may be different for an AI/ML method, than for a glm with random effects, than with causal inference, etc.  Specific to geography, a large portion of published research uses spatially explicit and implicit terminology interchangeably making it difficult to know what was actually done without reproducible code and data.","The cost of repeated sampling in geographical field is too high","The development of comparative research"
