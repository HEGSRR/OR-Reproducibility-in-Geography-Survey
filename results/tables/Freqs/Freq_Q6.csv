","As a historical geographer, working with qualitative research methods, I understand reproducibility more in terms of sources than of methods. I see reproducible research as being that which makes clear the origin and location of its data.","As a qualitative researcher doing in-depth case study research, my studies can not be perfectly reproduced. But reproducibility sits in the openness about methods and data collection practices, as well as critical reflection about strengths and weaknesses of my research. When we write about those things in the methods section in our papers and theses, their reproducibility is increased. ","Based on principles developed by Argyris and Schon and more recently and fully within different branches of Action Research, our research blends both traditional surveys, reflective workshops and other participatory methods, with the development of programs, such as ""Kool Routes to School"", which we then test and co-create with partners in schools, neighbourhoods, cities and regions.

In my more qualitative work, I make clear the methodological principles followed (semi-structured interview, coding, etc.) such that while the work may not be 'reproducible' in the same way, one could conduct a similar study.

Honestly, beyond testing my own results for rigor and ensuring that others can understand (and if they want adapt/revisit) my own analysis, I do not worry about this.","For someone to be able to recreate my work based on the information I provide in the methods.","For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study is replicated.","For the term ""reproducibility"", I am more concerned with the broader applicability of the research method or results.","Giving enough details about the empirical analysis undertaken in order to make it possible, for other reserachers, to reproduce the study ","Here is my personal definition of 'reproducibility': a method to evaluate study findings by repeating the experiment using the same parameters (potentially numerous times) and comparing the resulting data sets. Having dissimilar (nonreproduced) values may call the validity of the study’s methods into question, but it does not necessarily automatically invalidate the initial findings.
Reproducibility, in my opinion, seems to be a growing issue in certain quantitative studies, e.g. lab or survey work. 
My work is creating surficial geologic maps. In this context, the issue of reproducibility is unlikely to be realistically address due to some qualitative methods. The product is a representation of sedimentological and lithological interpretations which based on numerous observations which are combined with past knowledge to create interpretations. The scale, effort, and opportunistic nature (e.g. seeing a newly dug construction site) of data collection does not allow for the work to be easily reproduced. Areas are rarely re-mapped at the same scale. Some areas are not remapped in the same century. In other words, once created these maps are authoritative for generations. Which is not necessarily a good thing. 
","I am a paleoclimatologist working on sediment chronology and geochemistry. Thus, data reproducibility is the first priority in our research. Further, the paleoclimate reconstruction, we make as per the geochemical variability should corroborate and thus reproduced with the globally accepted understanding of the climatic episodes. ","I associate the term reproducibility mostly with quantitative methods and quantitative data. Although even in those contacts there can be quite a degree of variation in what is possible with respect to reproducibility. In my experience there is an increasing effort on the part of journals another publication venues to make the data underlying research reported and publications available with those publications. This is much easier to do with quantitative data (especially when it is anonymous). Essentially reproducibility boils down to the ability of researchers who may wish to check the results claim to buy other researchers.","I don't use the term in my own research. To me it simply means that a certain result or set of results in a study can be reproduced in another study. ","I have never heard it before in the context of my research. It was never mentioned in any of my PhD training programmes (UK). I assume it means: 'if someone else was to study this topic, would they come to the same conclusions'. In the social sciences, reproducibility is assumed to be difficult to achieve due to each researcher's positionality. Instead, we write our positionalities into our research and don't tend to strive for reproducibility per se, as life scientists would.","I prefer using replicability. It means validate research results with a high degree of reliability if the analysis is replicated","I study transportation infrastructure in cities (streets, sidewalks, bus stops, bike lanes, etc.). For any study I complete, I want the methods to be incredibly clear and datasets to be accessible, such that any interested researcher could re-do the entire study. That is how I think about the work being 'reproducible.'","I understand it refers to what extent a research methodology and its resulting data set can be reproduced in other place or by other research team to confirm those original results","I understand reproducibility within the frame of teh Galilean Scientific Method","I understand this term in direct association with the principles of the scientific method","I would understand it to mean that research findings can be reproduced in additional studies (ie. someone could follow my research design and presumably come up with the same results). It strikes me as a term that makes more sense for researchers using quantitative methods, however. As someone who largely deploys ethnographic and qualitative methods it is hard for me to imagine any of my work ever being reproducible (and would ignore the fact that my research findings are less about my study design and more about my interpretation/analysis). ","I'm actually not sure. I primarily conduct qualitative research and I'm not familiar with the term when it comes to qualitative research. I use the term transferability, reproducibitlity sound more quantitative.","If another researcher (independent) performs the same experiments as I do, the outcomes should lie within a given uncertainty limit. The experiments should be repeatable and the results not a unique occurrence.","if some had access to the same research participants/primary sources and were using the same methods, they would come to the same conclusions/analysis","If someone were to travel to my study sites, employ a similar sampling strategy and invest a comparable effort in the lab I believe they would come to the same results and conclusions that my colleagues and I did.","If you are researching a particular concept/topic and situate it in the current disciplinary understanding, reproducibility means that you're able to apply a known method or establish an accepted understanding in your hypotheses and through your new research effort, confirm or validate that approach or understanding.   ","In a broad sense, reproducibility in my research would mean that the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset always yield the same result. I distinguish it from research that is replicable, robust, or generalizable. Reproducibility requires a series of actions on the part of the researcher, such as when authors provide all the code and data necessary to recreate the analysis, as per Claerbout and Karrenback (1992), or when measurements can be independently obtained with stated precision levels by a different and independent research team, as per Ivie and Thain (2018) in ACM Comput Survey. Similar to Stodden's (2020) approach, I also consider computational reproducibility (code, hardware details, readme are made available), empirical reproducibility (open data, data access issues, appropriate interoperability, metadata, standards, ontological frameworks), and analytics reproducibility (details on model parameters, hyperparameters are made known). In my work, reproducibility crosses over into replicability - and it may be necessary to have replicability as the scientific threshold - where the same analytics performed on different datasets yields similar results. This is due to the fact that many of the datasets I work with are sensitive, containing potentially personally identifiable data, that requires special permission to use, or are not shareable because they are privately held, or are synthetically generated by private organizations. This is similar to code not being shareable if the provenance of legacy code is unavailable. Reproducible research is the gold standard and a desirable characteristic, but it may not always be possible, despite the researcher's desires and intentions.","In short, I understand reproducibility to be the ability of other researchers to use the same methods on the same data to produce the same results.","In short, the idea of reproducibility implies that, regardless of the researcher, when research is conducted using the same data, methods, and ideas/research questions, subsequent researchers will arrive at the same results.
As a geographer who largely employs qualitative methods, this notion reflects the grotesque extent to which qualitative researchers are expected to scientize (mimic the scientific vernacular, questions, and processes) in their work in order to acquire funding.
Working abroad with populations who do not share the same native language, where there are certainly different views and practices concerning gender, race/ethnicity, education, class, and varying stereotypes of who researchers are, what and why they're researching a particular topic, etc., this kind of notion of ""reproducibility"" is really a ridiculous idea that only the most quantitatively stuck (and socially stunted) human geographers would say is possible. It is not the same thing for physical geographers as it is for human geographers, in the same way that notions of what is generalizable do not align neatly and can even conflict.","In the hard sciences it is ability to trace a research process in order to reconstruct how a specific outcome was achieved.
In the social sciences this does not make too much sense and I would interpret reproducibility as and ability to use an established research approach or methodology in order to achieve significant (not identical) results in a different research context ","Interpolation ","It is an experimental standard.
","It is possible to reproduce the results with the same data","It is the ability of third parties to obtain the same results presented in a study using the same database.","it means having methods that can be utilized by other researchers to come to similar findings","Make sure that if other investigators repeat the same kind of analysis, they will obtain similar or same results.","Making your code and data available and explaining how you got there so that someone could carry out your research. ","Methodology which can be used by otjer researchers","Methods and algorithms must be reproducible, i.e. lead to identical results ","Methods, sampling strategy and decisions during processing and analysis are to be described in detail so that the study can be repeated with a high chance of obtaining similar/identical results. Any inferences and conjectures are to be made explicit.","Much more limited than even fields with known reproducibility problems, like psychology. I may release some R code and a cleaned data set.","My field is luminescence dating. Reproducibility means that I get the same age for more than one sample from the same layer, or that another lab gets the same age from the same sample that I processed.","My interpretation of reproducibility is that results are communicated in a transparent way to ensure the study can be replicated in the future.  ","My reporting about the research should be so transparent that other researchers would be able to do the same research and check their results against mine. If possible the data I collected/used should be made available to the public so as to allow a replication study.","My research is clearly and correctly described, so that the other people can get the same result if he or she do the same thing as I describe.","My understanding about the term ""reproducibility"" in the context of my own research would imply that certain obtained results would be also obtained, perhaps to a certain degree of similarity, by others researchers using the same methods.","My understanding is that the quantitative data my colleagues and I collect will be identical, or nearly so, to the data collected from the same site or similar sites by other researchers. Of course, the interpretation of those data will be subject to biases inherently present in each researcher.","My understanding of the term is, that I have to work as scientifically correct and precise as possible, so that consequently others can proof or discard my findings.","new and fresh applications in more fields and innovant changes in these fields, like ITS, land administration, planning, daily life.","None.

Re-sampling the sites I worked on would be next to impossible, however, due to permits in a foreign country. ","Reproducibility has several aspects : 
-describe and make available methods and feedbacks in order to give all possible information to researchers or practitioners who would want to re use methods and protocols in other settings/context (not as easy as it sounds to provide useful and synthetic information, i try to have researchers that obersve experimentation with users to make proper feedsbacks)
-describe/make available methods and tools for appropriation re-use
-publication of analysis and feedbacks and dissemination in research conference and professional events
It is difficult to do all and not always possible (time consuming, intellectual property on data, not paid for in projects for stable and durable online availability, etc.)","Reproducibility in my case is the possibility of the replicating and repeating of the proposed approach","Reproducibility is related to but is not the same as replication.  In a computational context, it means that someone else can reproduce the workflow of a given study by a sufficiently clear description of the method and the provision of code, data, etc.  This will also allow verification - that the software does what it is intended to do.","Reproducibility is very important for our research.","Reproducibility means being able to create the same outputs using the same data and methods by another researcher. This definition changes slightly depending what science you focus on as it can be altered for more GIS/Data Science researchers as this term is used slightly differently in computer science. ","Reproducibility refers to the ability of peers to replicate the results of a research study. The results should be reproducible within a small margin of error if a peer follows the same methods outlined by the authors of the original research. ","Reproducibility suggests the ability of other researchers to replicate in form and function, at least in principle, the research that another scholar has produced. This requires careful detailing by the original researcher of sources, methods, and means of data collection as well as systems of analysis.","reproducibility to me is the development of knowledge, practices, and analysis protocols in the field and laboratory that can be applied to other places and areas of knowledge that have affinity with physical geography, especially soil science and paleoecology.","Reproducibility” refers to instances in which the original researcher's data and computer codes are used to regenerate the results, while “replicability” refers to instances in which a researcher collects new data to arrive at the same scientific findings as a previous study. In our research we used to this term to understand ""people traditional knowledge in terms of agriculture and soil conservation and other related fields""","Reproducible research usually publishes the data used to justify research claims. If the data cannot be published (as in my case), the description of the methods should allow researchers to replicate the results if they had the same data. These are the practical dimensions of reproducibility. Conceptually, reproducibility is about minimizing or eliminating the bias of subjective decisions, or contextualizing your findings with respect to the methodological choices you make as a researcher.","Reproduction of experimental results by a different research team by applying the same methods described by an initial research group","Research findings or phenomena can be replicated","research is replicable by others","Research methodology should be described and done in such a way as to allow any researcher to reproduce the same type of study based on the methodology described.","Research practices (including study design, execution, and reporting) that generate findings which may be reproduced by an independent research team following the same protocol.

Another aspect is whether my results reproduce the results of others.

For all of my work, ""reproducibility"" requires adequate description of the methods involved in gathering and analyzing data. By ""adequate"" I mean a peer could duplicate the techniques in the same or similar contexts, but not necessarily with precisely the same data. This includes both quantitative (survey, census, etc.) data and qualitative information (interviews, documents, etc.) With the latter, for example, the identity of the interviewees is typically confidential, and non-anonymous survey data cannot be shared. 

For quantitative work, reproducibility means that peers would arrive at precisely the same conclusions using the (anonymous) data and analytic techniques. This is primarily a check on errors in the data and analyses, and a check on fraudulent practices. They may arrive at different conclusions using the same data but different techniques, or when combined with additional data. And of course, they may have different interpretations of the same results. ","to be able to repeat research (e.g. at another time, other case studies) and further to make research comprehensible","To be able to reproduce the results using the same method and techical steps","To be able to reproduce, extrapolate and transfer approaches/outputs","to me this term would mean that the methods that have been used to conduct the research can be 'reproduced' by another researcher.  not quite the scientific hypothesis appraoch but not dissimilar ","To my understanding, reproducibility is a way in which a method, tool, and concept that one has originally produced in his/her research work can be reproduced in other research activities.  For example, OSMnx is a simple python code tool that has been developed by Prof. Geoff Boeing. The tool is used by other researchers to extract road networks from OSM. The road networks that are extracted using this tool can also be reproduced in many ways in ArcGIS.","To publish data and software which led to the research results related to a published study/article.

But outside of qualitative work I understand ""reproducibility"" to mean that statistical/data/empicial evidence should be able to be examined and analysis conducted by other researchers should be able to replicate the steps that the original researcher took to achieve their results.
