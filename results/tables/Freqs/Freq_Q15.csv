2. Lack of publishing research protocols or computer code","1. The cost of engaging in such research if you are attempting to reproduce research over a number of sites.

2.The lack of importance attached to reproducibility in qualitative research in the social sciences","1) Streotype Journals
2) lack of secondary dataset
3) cost of licenced software","Access to research subjects/ethnographic spaces, IRB constraints, use of theory and subjectivity, and the specific political, geographical, and temporal conditions under which research is conducted.","Anthropogenic (and to a lesser extent natural) landscape change in regional archaeological survey continually alters the ""population"" and ""samples"" of the population that are studied, resulting in an impossibility of 100% reproducibility (as the materials being studied themselves change over time). For that reason I defined reproducibility in this subfield based only on reproducing of methods and workflows, etc.","Applying statistical methods designed for lab experiments to observational data. Small sample sizes and not dealing head on with the fact they will never be much bigger. Researchers evaluating and synthesizing knowledge mostly intuitively but claiming (and believing) they are relying only on empiricism.","Case study research involving human subjects perceptions.","Complexity of interpretation of data","data cleaning - i.e. even if you start with the same raw data, often decisions are made (and not documented) where missing values, or odd values, or outliers (as they are determined) are omitted, .   Even things like the choice of precision levels in data storage and analysis can accumulate over calculations and contribute to differences in findings.","Data confidentiality issues","Data may be proprietary or covered by data sharing agreements that prevent researchers from sharing, even if they want to.","Data privacy","Data selection for expected results of the authors.","Differences in how individual researchers identify certain phytolith morphotypes can result in variations in data to some extent. Depending on the extent of experience of the researcher some morphotypes many be missed or misidentified.","Disapproval from my academic advisor","epistemological frames","For my qualitative work, the concept of ""reproducibility"" assumed by these questions does not really apply.","For physical geography, the world is a heterogeneous place and many results may not be reproducible despite being correct. For instance, I could sample two walls within the same soil pit and get slightly different results. Hopefully, they would produce similar conclusions though. If someone tried to reproduce my field results and failed, I'd be more curious than upset. In the lab, I would hope that my work would be fully reproducible.","Hard to answer some of these given range of methods I use.","I believe reproducibility is a practice that still needs to be embraced and disseminated among researchers as part of their research publication process.","I don't understand this question.","I have very little to comment here as I do not regard this as a major issue in my area of qualitative geographic research","in human geography, context (timing, location, events) can have impacts","In my field, new knowledge and insights are buried in data in private or government hands. My experience is that open data are not always useful in many contexts. Data access is also not reproducible (e.g. stream computing of LinkedIn data to study future of work), or geolocalization of non-geotagged Twitter data. It is not always possible to access that data to facilitate reproducibility by others. However, there are now a number of tools that can help move geographic analytics reproducibility to the next level.

As I discussed previously, reproducibility is a gold standard. When it is doable, it is great, and researchers should be supported with  reproducibility science, the tools and the know-how. It may not be achievable for myriad reasons. Replicability, robustness, and generalizability may serve as achievable aspirations where reproducibility is not possible.","It can be hard to repeat certain field studies, especially if they were investigating unique events or systems that are now lost (e.g. climate change effects)","it is difficult (impossible to some extent?) to list all factors that can influence results in an experimentation (whether very controlled or in real life). Most of the time many factors are overlooked, we would need an interdisciplinary framework and stabdarddisation of some key criteria to be described in all experimentation.
Fragmentation of research and lack of inter/transdisicplinary is the a big contributor to lack of reproducibility. Focusing on a specific effect with very little scope (E.G. one function in a geovisualization for instance) can lead to results with wery little to no significance. Many factors are just overlooked and would need to be observed by researchers from other disciplines.I worked with researchers in information and communication studies in experiments they made observations that no geographers could make. Segmenting and producing very specialized research is good for a career buit often useless : little significance, reproducibility if it exists, would not be very relevant anyway, situation are so far from real life that it is impossible to reuse. Specialization on very specific and technical topics sells good in sciences but failing to aim for a larger point of view and analysis often does not allow for the reuse of results.
So pressure to publish is also a huge factor in my opinion. if you want to be successful, you do not have the time to make transdicisplinary project, and you should not really take the time to discuss with other disciplines because others will publish more than you and get a job...","It is not part of training for Australian geographers. But it should be.","It will take a lot of time, which will delay our research work.","lack of duplicates of physical samples for analysis. For instance, radiocarbon samples are rarely kept after analysis for reanalysis by a different lab.","Lack of emphasis placed on reproducibility in the peer review process, which is fair because checking how reproducible a study is as a peer reviewer is incredibly time-consuming and it's already volunteer work that has little direct benefit.","Lack of funding for research makes it difficult to reproduce a study (”Why fund ”the same” study twice when there is a lack of research funding”)","Lack of knowledge","Lack of mentorship","Lack of reproducibility standards in some countries.
Predatory publishers where reviewing is 'light' at best.
Not providing all the necessary code and data","Low levels of computational literacy, a lot of manual GIS workflows are irreproducible.","MA","Methodology often described briefly and not detailed enough","Mismatch of available data; lack of specific software; lack of detailed information on methodologic decisions when using specific analysis.","My research is focussed on developing partnerships with community leaders to co-develop our research.  We use qualitative and participatory research methods.  There is no way that any research project could be 'reproduced' to get the same results with a different community - that's just not how it works.  The methods could be reproduced, no issue with that, but the partnerhips, the dynamics of the relationships, the opinons, values, aspirations shared by one community group is not likely to be the same as another community group. Further, the original community partnership is not going to want to do the same research again with another researcher, as what would be the point of that?  Hopefully, via the original encounter, they would have found out what they needed to learn.  So this notion of 'reproducibility' doesn't seem to apply.","NA","Nature of long-term qualitative data collection, which includes establishing relationships, rapport, and familiarity with study sites, communities, and people. Even gaining access to informants and communities can be difficult, and also context-dependent. By its very nature doing the same work -- even with the same research protocol in the same place -- could provide different data; although major conclusions may be reproducible.","no","none","often ignorance, most frequently lack of understanding of what science is.","Peer review process is flawed. The review report is kept confidential.","Perhaps a view that the studied field is so variable and diverse that having the same initial conditions is rare","proprietary data formats or dependence on proprietary software","Qualitative methods are hard/impossible to reproduce according to your definition of reproducibility. This study should either focus only on quantiative studies or use a more open, less tech-focussed, understanding of reproducibility.","Question seems to be applying that we should all be striving for reproducibility, an assertion I don't agree with. This ignore the critical role of interpretation and analysis and assumes a specific kind of research design that is now shared by most in my subfield.","reality is not always reproducible","Reluctance to share raw data, which either cost a lot or was collected with great effort and we hope to use it again (Why should I give my data to everyone for free?). As a result, we don't want to make them public. Even in group teams, disputes arise as to who may use the jointly collected data in the future. At our university, there were even official judgments as to whether someone had the right to use the data on their own (for a new article) or not, when they were previously collected in groups. And let's make them public for everyone! The authors do not want to make the data public, treating it as something covered by copyright. I also think that psychological considerations can make a difference. Additionally, in Poland, no attention has been paid to the issue of publishing the collected raw data to the public. We had no such traditions in unwritten social norms, nor in written rules. Only for a few years have national grants require open publications.","Researcher error in data analysis","Scientisst wan to exploit their own data first and benefit from the outcoming publications in terms of career advancement","Selective and subjective removal of data from a database based on personal biases that suggest that the apparently anomalous data are erroneous.","Simply not relevant to predominant methodologies","Some research has a major ethnographic component, which is never reproducible.","Some urban geographical data is extremely hard to find (e.g. urban market values)","Speaking only for myself, the major factor in a lack of reproducibility is not giving a single iota of thought as to whether my work is reproducible, as I don't value reproducibility as an inherent marker of good research.","specifically in the context of archaeological research, and in some cases sampling of soils or sediments,                             once the original material runs out it is very difficult to acquire samples from the same locations, or contexts. I think that many people publish datasets of measurements, and describe their laboratory protocols, but it would be difficult for other completely separate researchers to acquire the same samples.","The epistemologies used in social sciences, human geography, nature-society studies don't lend themselves to reproducibility - instead, we write our positionalities into our work.","The lack of clear, easy-to-follow instructions on how to run analytic scripts limits reproduction or at least noticeably increases the time spent reproducing the work of others. In my opinion, having access to the code is not enough because authors, for example, do not usually associate the findings of an article (table, figure, statistics, etc.) with the corresponding scripts or analysis. One solution is as simple as writing a concise README: I ran this to create Figure 1, then ran this and that to get Table 2, etc. Alternatively, authors can provide a single entry point (main script) to run the entire analysis to produce all of the findings of a paper , but this is not always possible. So, some clear lines of instructions help a lot.","The social environment is not like a laboratory; usually it cannot be controlled (unless in experiments where researchers create a controlled environment).","There is a problem i your frasing of the questions which is biased toward that reproducibility is par se a desiarable thing for instance you do not ask if it is relevant at all - secondly your questions is biased toward quantitative data. Doing interviews and fieldwork in accordance with ethical standarts which require  forinstance anynomity prevents us from publishing 1000 of pags of transcription and field notens.  transparancy is in my opinion much more important that an apriori standardization of reproductibility.","This is totally not a thing in qualitative / cultural geography research. I get why it is in STEM/quant research but my fields are trying to explore nuance and detail of specific lives experiences. Reproducibility is not possible or desirable","This is very relative -- if researchers adapt an instrument to their reality, has reproducibility been well served or undermine? I don't think anything we produce is absolutely true in all conditions. Everything is based on assumptions that reflect specific places and contexts. Speaking as someone from the Global South it is very troubling how often the Global North is taken as the norm and standard, when so many conditions are so different from our realities. We are ""othered"" and have to conform in ways that researchers from the Global North often do not. There is an assumption of universality for the latter, and exceptionality for our work.","time resources
financial resources (esp. when you have no permanent contract and need to deliver)
data used that actually is reproducable is often secondary data (e.g. survey data, censuses, official statistics)
geographic specifities and their changes over time - very often geographic research is descriptive and observes developments","Time. There is little value given to reproducing work that has already been done by someone else. Grants won't support that kind of work. I also doubt a journal would publish an article that exactly repeats another article and finds the same results (not novel). These factors make reproducing other's work off the list of priorities with the limited time most university faculty have.","Training specific to reproducibility at the graduate and early career levels.","Unawareness of the importance of the concept.","Understanding of the issue. Reproducibility does not always mean the ability to obtain the exact results of the prime researcher/team, but to replicate the research (e.g. if including interviews) and come to similar conclusions.","Understanding the instrumentation that provides data for interpretation, its discrepancies and complexities","unwillingness of researchers to include raw data in publications","Using secure data that cannot be disclosed"
