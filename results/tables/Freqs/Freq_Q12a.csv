"","","As a part of deeping research to submit. ","As most of the Journals are streotype and want to publish known results only. Therefore it is difficult to publish the results which are not universal.","Did not attempt","Haven't tried.","I completed the reproduction to bolster my own confidence in the research and didn't feel a need to publish.","I do not understand the question","I have been able to submit findings from my reproductions, except in those instances where a conscious decision was made not to due to time constraints or study scope. ","I have no reason to not submit all of the findings. ","I submit all of my experimental data for publication.","I was not interested","I was replicating some previous studies and learning about the code. Once I was familiar about the methods and codes then I performed my own research using different statistical data.","I'm still writing my manuscripts to be submitted","I'm working on that...It will be published","It was part of the peer-review process for another manuscript","Just some minor deviations in estimated coefficients. ","lack of time or importance","Not yet.","That isn't the context of how/why I've reproduced analysis. In my subfield, access to the original data is rare. I have only done reproduction of work within my own lab to double-check findings before submitting for publication.","That was not the point of my reproduction. I was trying to reproduce my own research prior to publication.","The geochemical data reproducibility of the sediment samples could have been the major reason not to proceed with interpretation followed by publication. The poor reproducibility of data (accuracy and precision) may lead to spurious data and its trends which might lead to erroneous past climate reconstruction.","Usually  the validation results are presented in the paper to show that the techniques/analysis used are valid.","We are very rigorous in presenting methods in scientific articles, but because we are using mostly qualitative data, which requires sensitive insightful handling by knowledgeable and skilled researchers, we do not publish detailed data, such as transcripts, particularly since participants often seek acknowledgement, rather than anonymity, because they trust us and want recognition of their contribution to the knowledge produced. We know we have developed the guidelines to respect this trust and intentions, but would require further consent to hand data forward to other researchers who are not known to participants.","we felt that even though it confirmed a prior finding, the originality of it (lack) would be make publication challenging ","We were testing out different methods. We moved on after comparing a few methods. Never got the time to revisit. This happens all the time."
